CREATING GIT AND ADDING IT TO THE LOCAL REPOSITORY

-->Download the git and setup the Git in the local machine.
-->Create a dirictory where you want to work on your project.
-->Use GIT INIT command to initialize the new GIT repo in the dirictory.
-->Write your code or what ever your working on in that dirictory.
-->Use GIT ADD command to add the code to the staging area, it adds the files and also tracks the files changes.
-->Now use the GIT COMMIT command to save the staged changes to the local repo, It also gives the snapshots of all the details.

PUSHNING THE FILE TO THE LOCAL REPOSITORY

-->Use the command GIT PUSH ORIGIN MAIN it uploads from local repo main branch to remote repo main branch named origin all to the main branch.
-->origin” is just a name (alias) that points to the URL or SSH address of the remote repository you copied or used when you created or cloned the repository

LEARNING GIT TAG

-->Git tag is like an important spot in your project that referes to the important bug fixes and version releases 
-->When tags are created they stick to the same commit and it cannot be changed
-->There are two types of tags annoated tags and lightweight tags, annoated tag has more details about the version and lightweight is kind of private bookmarks 


GIT CLONING

--> It makes a complete copy of existing files in the local computer from the remote repo so that we can work on the project on local machine.


ABOUT BRANCHING

-->Branching helps us to move away from the main code to work on the new features to add to the main code 
--> If it successfully runs we can add it to the main code
