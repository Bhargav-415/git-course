WORKING OF GIT BRANCHES
--> It is kind of a life saver working on new features that will not affect the main branch, by creating a branch.
--> Each branch is an independent line of development, allowing you to experiment or fix bugs without disturbing the main codebase.
--> You can create multiple branches for different features or bug fixes and merge them back when ready.
--> Branches make collaboration easier, as each contributor can work on their own branch and later integrate changes.

ABOUT PARENT COMMITS
--> In Git, every commit (except the first) has one or more parent commits.
--> The parent commit is the previous commit that your current commit builds upon.
--> In a normal commit, there is a single parent; in a merge commit, there are two or more parents (representing the branches being merged).
--> Parent commits help Git track the history and relationships between changes, making it possible to visualize and manage branches and merges.
